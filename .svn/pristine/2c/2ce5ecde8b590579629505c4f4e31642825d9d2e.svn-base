<h2>About the Game</h2>
Taming the Elements is an action/combat/strategy game about leveling and collecting
a Garrion of elementals.<br/>
In a world called Pria, a disturbance has unfolded and it
is up to you as the tamer to restore the balance.
You begin the game with just one elemental in your Garrison 
(your collection of elementals).  Missions include leveling that elemental (by gaining XP)
and growing your Garrison.  Capture other elementals and add them to your
Garrison.  After you have grown your Garrison, you can form a team of 3 elementals and
do battle with your team.  Certain elementals are stronger against others (like water can
douse fire) and certain characters may be more effective than others.
as each elemental has different abilities, speed and health.  
This game is inspired by Archon II, World of Warcraft Pet Battles and Mavel vs Capcom.
When you are ready ... champion your strongest team of elementals and do battle 
with the disturbance that awaits at the center of Pria.
