* update description for abilities
* update description for characters
* xcf to png ... resize, frame info
* circus of slime/ ice shards  ... its an autokill at point blank
* capture will put a debuff.  Must kill opponent within that debuff time to capture
* on chapter2 objectives, show the Capture icon as new ability gained
* applyDamageOverride in abilities.js is questionable - use Components.Range.createHitCallback
