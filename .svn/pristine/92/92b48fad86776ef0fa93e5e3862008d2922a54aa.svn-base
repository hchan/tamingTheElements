			Unbalance has erupted in the world <span class="gameWorldName"></span>.<br />
			You must tame and assemble of team of elementals to open a Portal to
			the center of <span class="gameWorldName"></span> and restore the
			balance.

			<div>You begin with a random elemental at Level 1 that is added to your Summoner's List. Enter the
				Battleground (after choosing a battleground difficulty (Easy,
				Average, Hard, Very Hard)) to fight other elementals.</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Battleground Difficulties</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Easy (levels 1 to 5)is unlocked by default.</li>
					<li>Average (levels 6 to 10)is unlocked by leveling an elemental to Level 5</li>
					<li>Hard (levels 11 to 15)is unlocked by leveling an elemental to Level 10</li>
					<li>Very Hard (levels 16 to 20) is unlocked by leveling an elemental to Level 15</li>
					<li>??? (Portal to the Center of Pria) is unlocked by leveling
						an elemental to Level 20</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
			<h2>Leveling up</h2>
			
				To level up an elemental, you must win a battle.
				The last elemental to deliver the final death blow against the opponent is rewarded with a level point.				
			
				Note, you cannot level up to a higher above your difficulty setting in
				the Battleground. (i.e. if you are at level 5 and enter the
				Batteground at the Easy difficulty setting, you will not gain experience and level up to level 6).
				To continue to level 6, you must enter the Battleground at the Average difficulty.
				</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Abilities gained as you level</h2>
				When your elemental reaches:
				<ul>
					<li>Level 5, you gain the ability to tame elementals. You are
						restricted to tame based to a weaker elemental type of your own (See Elemental
						Balance)</li>
					<li>Level 10, you gain the ability to create a team and allow
						swapping within that team</li>
					<li>Level 15, new ability (specific to the Race)</li>
					<li>Level 20 - passive ability - bonus armour/damage against a weaker elemental
						type (See Elemental Balance)</li>
					<li>Level 20 - in PvP instead of tame, you have an elemental imbalance skill.  i.e, Douse Fire (water)</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			
			<div class="balanceEquation">
				<h2>Elemental Balance</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Water can douse Fire, thus Fire is weaker than Water.</li>
					<li>Fire can consume Air, thus Air is weaker than Fire</li>
					<li>Air can blow away Earth, thus Earth is weaker than Air</li>
					<li>Earth can contain Water, thus Water is weaker than Earth</li>
				</ul>
				<div>Note 1: Elementals at level 5 and up can tame elementals of a weaker type</div>
				<div>Note 2: Elementals at level 20 have a passive ability that will add bonus to armour and damage to a weaker elemental type</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Taming Elements</h2>
				This ability can only be used against an elemental of a weaker type
				(See Elemental Balance) AND if that elemental is at the same level
				or lower than the elemental trying to tame it. 
				Your chance of taming a weaker elemental type at the same level as you is 50%
				and increases as the number of levels you are above the opponent by 10% per level.
				Furthermore, a
				restriction is that you can only tame an elemental if it is < 25%
				health. Once an elemental is tamed, the battle will continue until
				all other members have been in the opposing team have been defeated.
				You can only tame one elemental per battle. Should you win the
				battle, that elemental you have tamed will become accessible for you
				to summon in the next battleground. However, if you lose, that
				elemental you have tamed will be released. Taming more than 3
				elementals of the same Race will evict the one with the lowest
				level. You can only have a maximum of 3 elementals of the Race at
				any given time.
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Damage, Armour and bonus</h2>
				Damage is the amount that will be subtracted to the health of an
				opponent. Armour is the amount of damage that is reduced. For
				example, if the opponent's health is 100, his armour is 15 an your
				damage is 40, then a a net damage of 25 is done to the opponent
				resulting in his health of 75. Note that bonuses may be applied
				depending on your Elemental type (See Elemental Balance) and your
				level. The bonus than an element gets over an another based on level
				is as follows: <br /> amour bonus: 2 * (difference in level)^1.5<br />
				damage bonus: 5 * (difference in level)^1.5<br />
